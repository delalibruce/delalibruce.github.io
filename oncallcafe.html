      <h2>Design Challenge</h2>
      <p>community is the lifeblood of a college campus yet at Stanford, you can count the number of spaces solely dedicated to facilitating a strong sense community, also known as “third spaces” (places that are not your dorm or the classroom/library), on one hand, even less so when it’s late at night. 
        </p>

              <h2>Solution</h2>
              <p>together with a determined team of individuals, we founded on call cafe to help change that. designed to be a cafe for stanford students, by stanford students where we embrace the weird and wonderful. the vision for this space is to be a vibrant hub for students to laugh, converse, and connect over nourishing, comfort food. 
        </p>

              <h2>The Process</h2>
              <p><b>phase one:</b> we tested this with a rapid prototype: a two-night pop up, acting as a proof of concept that if well-executed and received could lead to a permanent, legacy space on campus. with an eager team of 40+ students, we completed this phase within two weeks. The <a href="https://stanforddaily.com/2023/11/15/on-call-cafe-answering-the-call-for-community/"target="_blank">response</a> from the student body was incredible. Both nights, the line for students circled around the block before we had even opened. We served over 1000+ students in two days. With this success, we secured funding and a promise for a <a href="https://stanforddaily.com/2023/12/07/on-call-cafe-finds-a-home-in-old-union/"target="_blank">permanent space</a> from the administration.<br><br>

              <b>phase two:</b> now that we are <a href="https://stanforddaily.com/2023/12/04/ugs-funds-on-call-cafe/"target="_blank">funded</a>, we are working full speed ahead to open officially. we will have a second pop up in the winter quarter and the timeline to opening long-term is currently set for spring 2024. in the meantime, we are working on hiring to expand the team, securing a space on campus, completing the financial model, designing and building our facilities, and applying for official health permits from the county. 
              </p>
              <h2>My Role</h2>
              <p>i joined the founding team as the cafe director to design and lead cafe operations. my responsibilities include setting the vision for the cafe experience (making sure every aspect of the cafe is centered around our vision), developing and testing a signature menu, sourcing ingredients, training and leading a team of 30+ baristas and toastmasters, and creating a seamless food and drink operation to serve hundreds of students.
